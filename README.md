##  Programming Sandbox

### [Laravel Playground](https://laravelplayground.com)

Mostly to test Gist and Small code snippets, you also have access to some Laravel libraries like Carbon and Debugbar

### [PHP Sandbox](https://phpsandbox.io/)

Haven´t fully tested the site, but seems more complete than Laravel Playground, since it can show the full laravel project files,  it can also be used to create plain PHP index files, although you can´t change the PHP version.

### [Implode.io](https://implode.io)

This sandbox is a bit simpler, you can run a basic index.php file, does not seem to support multiple files, it has a drop down for frameworks, but doesn´t seem to work, the cool thing is you can change between PHP versions.

### [Tailwind Play](https://play.tailwindcss.com)

Geared to static site makers, this little playground has the most basic features to start learning how to work with Tailwind CSS

### [Code Sandbox](https://codesandbox.io)

This playground has support for lots of various JS frameworks, like Angular, Vue, React, I was even surprised to see NestJs and NuxtJs in the list.

### [CodePen.io](https://codepen.io)

This is the most known playground, since its been on line for a while, it started as a page where you can share your css creations, but has expanded to support JS frameworks and libraries.

### [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net)

This site focuses more on HTML and vanilla JS snippets, you can add JS libraries via CDN.

### [LabStack](https://code.labstack.com)

This sandbox support multiple languages like Rust / Java etc, but only on CLI mode, you can use it mostly to test functions, or when following a tutorial.
